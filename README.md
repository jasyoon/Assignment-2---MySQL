## Source Files
1. `main.py`
2. `assignment2_DDL.sql`
3. `Customers.sql`
4. `OrderDetails.sql`
5. `Orders.sql`
6. `Products.sql`
7. `Suppliers.sql`
8. `README.md`

## Additional Notes
- `assignment2_DDL.sql` must be imported first. It should also include the 2 necessary procedures for the assignment
- all the other sql files can be imported after which include the data that I used to test the assignment
- I sort of scuffed my way through input validation for the menu; a valid number with no spaces must be inputted
    - I made the input be a string and not an int to get around needing to check if the input was an integer
- when doing an invalid input on the two procedure options, it should continue the program but output the error
    - if you mess up in the beginning though, you still need to input all other fields to continue
